## Summary
Overall, it can be seen that the bike sharing business has a strong demand during peak office/traffic hours on the weekdays, as well as mid-day over the weekends. Before starting the business, I would like to gain further insight into other times of the year as well further insight into customer demographic details. I would like to run visualizations to compare results from rides in December vs the data we already have for rides in August to verify that this is a sustainable and year round business. If so, I would like to see additional data on various weather patterns throughout the year, so we know what to generally expect. Additionally, I would like to see a deeper breakdown for the male and female users. How many of each are subscribers vs customers, what are their age groups, ethnicities, type of profession, frequency of their rides, to name a few.
