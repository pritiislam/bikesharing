## Overview
The purpose of this project is to support the exploration of implementing a bike share program in Des Moines. This analysis will show insight into how the bike share business works in NYC. From here, we can make an estimated proposal as to how it might work in Des Moines. 

## Results
![City Bike Overview](1.png)
As you can see, there is a need for city bikes cross multiple variables such as date, customer type and age. Also, there is a higher volume of rides among the younger generations, which will be our target customer group.

It is clear that there is a higher volume of rides during peak evening/rush hours, i.e. 4-6. 

![Checkout Time by Gender](3.png)
The overall shape of the curve remains consistent with our total numbers, but it is obvious that there is a much higher demand among the male customer base.

As expected, it is can be confirmed that the demand for rides are much higher during peak rush hours such as 6-9am as well as 4-7pm on weekdays. Additionally, rides seem to be generally popular during midday on weekends for leisure, tourism, etc.

To further our investigation, this heat map helps to support our prior claims, i.e. we hold a stronger demand for males and for rush hour timings throughout the week.

Lastly, we can see here that we have a heavier demand for rides within our subscriber customer base. Moving forward, it would be advisable to push for customers to engage with our subscription plan to continue growing this space. Also, we can simultaneously push for more female riders to subscribe and invite their friends.

## Summary
Overall, it can be seen that the bike sharing business has a strong demand during peak office/traffic hours on the weekdays, as well as mid-day over the weekends. Before starting the business, I would like to gain further insight into other times of the year as well further insight into customer demographic details. I would like to run visualizations to compare results from rides in December vs the data we already have for rides in August to verify that this is a sustainable and year round business. If so, I would like to see additional data on various weather patterns throughout the year, so we know what to generally expect. Additionally, I would like to see a deeper breakdown for the male and female users. How many of each are subscribers vs customers, what are their age groups, ethnicities, type of profession, frequency of their rides, to name a few.
